Hi people,

I will release here my developed just 4 fun games. Planned is to release ever 2-4 weeks a new simple funny game.

To play the Java-Games you have to install the <a href="https://www.java.com/de/download/manual.jsp">Java-Runtime-Environment</a> for your appropriate operating system (Windows, Linux, MacOS) and download and execute the starter file ```<game_name>.bat``` (batch-file) and Java-Game-File ```<game_name>.jar``` (java archive)  which is included also in the games download directory!

Have fun and enjoy them!

And now in the sense of the ancient romans:

"Let the games begin..." :video_game:

"Ave imperator, morituri :skull: te salutant!" :thumbsdown: :hand: :thumbsup:
